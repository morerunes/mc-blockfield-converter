MC Block Field Converter
========================

TL;DR
-----

This program can be used to turn [this](/example.bf) 
into this: ![example](/example.png), or vice versa.

You can use the block field files one of two ways.

1. (*Recommended*) Use the included standalone application to convert
   your block field files to java classes useable by
   [MCP](http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases)

2. Package the included static libraries with your mod and
   use the generateFromBFFile() method to generate your
   structure from a file at runtime.

If you don't want to manually create the block field files,
you can download my related mod (*TBD*)
